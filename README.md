## Components
- R [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app development framework was leveraged for developing and deploying the app modules.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library was leveraged for interactive map visualization, map features, and interactions.
- [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) library was leveraged for data processing.
- [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) was leveraged for choosing a colorblind safe color palette.

## Limitations
